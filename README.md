# Driver-s-License-Test

## Background

This project is investigating the effect of several learning strategies and learning
parameters on test performance. We will be using quiz, video, and reading materials
from a curriculum from the Department of Motor Vehicles in New York, and evaluating
participants on a content-related quiz to see how study strategies and learning
parameters affect quiz score.

## Hypothesis Testing

H0: There is no effect of study strategy or learning parameter on test scores.

H1: The high factor settings will show an increase in test scores.

## Data Collection

Data was collected using blind testing
